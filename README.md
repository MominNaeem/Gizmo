This program helps engineers with building circuits and testing out new components outside of the school environment. With many gate chips, such as an ANDChip, NANDChip, ORChip, NORChip, XORChip, and a NOTChip. Logic gate chips are truly versatile chips. They do not have to be used just for pure logic circuits. In fact, they have a wide range of uses. They can be used as inverters, as active low inputs, active low outputs, active high inputs, active high outputs. One of the most used chips is the NAND gate. The differences from these chips are there pins and where they lead to in the chip itself.
